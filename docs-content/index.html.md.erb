This documentation describes the Snyk Service Broker for VMware Tanzu. The Snyk Service
Broker enables developers to scan their droplets for known vulnerabilities in open source components.
In addition, the Snyk Service Broker allows you to continuously monitor droplets for new vulnerabilities as well as preventing the deployment of vulnerable droplets.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The Snyk Service Broker registers a service broker with VMware Tanzu and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating a Snyk Service Broker service instance and binding it to an app will trigger Snyk to run scans on your app dependencies as part of the buildpack. Using environment variables, you can decide whether to continuously monitor your app, reject a vulnerable droplet, or patch the vulnerabilities inside your app.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

Snyk Service Broker includes the following key features:

* Scan your app dependencies for known vulnerabilities
* Continuously monitor your app dependencies for new vulnerabilities
* Reject a vulnerable droplet from being deployed
* Patch you app dependencies during buildpack phase
